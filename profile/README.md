Hello! Welcome to the project "Reiseberichte karTRIERt".

You can find the website at [kartriert.github.io](https://kartriert.github.io).

This project was realised in the context of a project of the Master of Science Digital Humanities (DH) in the winter semester 2022/23 at Trier University. The aim was to choose a topic autonomously and develop it using the methods obtained during previous semesters. Seven students worked on this project: Tatiana Bessonova, Lisa Braune, Sarah Ondraszek, Edda Schwarzkopf, Jan Philipp Simon, Solange Wagner and Svenja Wagner. It was supervised by the lecturers Dr. Joëlle Weis and Dr. Élodie Ripoll.
